# Caesar_Cipher

## Project Description:
This project is a simple web-based Caesar Cipher implementation using Flask and Python. The original code for the Caesar Cipher was sourced from **"The Big Book of Small Python Projects"** by Al Sweigart. This app allows users to encrypt or decrypt messages with a shift cipher, a basic encryption technique. The project was created to better understand the Flask framework and web development.

## Features:
- Encrypt and decrypt text messages.
- Simple web-based interface.
- Input a key between 0 and 25 for encryption/decryption.
- Shows real-time results after input.

## Tech Stack:
- Python (Flask)
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Frontend)
- GitHub (Hosting and Collaboration)

## Usage:
- Open the app in a web browser.
- Select whether you want to **Encrypt** or **Decrypt** a message.
- Enter a key (between 0 and 25).
- Input the message you want to encrypt or decrypt.
- The result will appear below.
